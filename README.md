# BoredApi
A very simple console app making requests to https://www.boredapi.com/

A chance for me to practice making requests and handling the responses from the API, You are given a list of the different types of activities you can do and the api will send you one at random from the activity type.

Error handling for responses and wrapped in a while loop so that the user can pick again when prompted.

Also made a front end version using razorpages.
